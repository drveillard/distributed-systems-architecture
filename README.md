### [[⬆]](#toc) <a name='tips'>System Design Interview Tips & PS/DS</a>

**Clarify the constraints and identify the user cases**

Spend a few minutes questioning the interviewer and agreeing on the scope of the system.
Remember to make sure you know all the requirements the interviewer didn't tell you about in the beginning.

User cases indicate the main functions of the system, and constraints list the scale of the system such as requests 
per second, requests types, data written per second, data read per second.

In a real world scenario, beyond a white-board interview setting one must understand the `functional` & `non-functional` requirements of an 
engineering project.

**High-level architecture design**

Sketch the important components and the connections between them, but don't go into some details. 
Usually, a scalable system includes webserver (load balancer), service (service partition), database (primary/secondary database cluster plug cache).
 
**Component design**

For each component, you need to write the specific APIs for each component. You may need to finish
the detailed OOD design for a particular function. You may also need to design the database schema for the database.

**Revist Basic PS/DS & Machine Coding Questions**

Basics of OOPs, SOLID Concepts, algorithms and data structures will help a lot in clearing most tof the onsite interviews at large tech companies. Having a habit of solving problems on LeetCode or CodeFoces will definitely help in thinking faster and better in terms of approach to problem solving.

#### Tips for OOD Interview

**Clarify the scenario, write out user cases**

Use case is a description of sequences of events that, taken together, lead to a system doing something useful. Who is going to use it and how they are going to use it. The system may be very simple or very complicated.

Special system requirements such as multi-threading, read or write oriented.

**Define objects**

Map identity to class: one scenario for one class, each core object in this scenario for one class.

Consider the relationships among classes: certain class must have unique instance, one object has many other objects (composition), one object is another object (inheritance).

Identify attributes for each class: change noun to variable and action to methods.

Use design patterns such that it can be reused in multiple applications.
